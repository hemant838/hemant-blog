## **Note:** You may notice that some files appear to be 3 months old. Please don’t consider this as any kind of cheating — the project was initialized on the same day it's being worked on. We’re just making use of an older setup. This is purely for clarification.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First intall dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then create an .env file in root of the folder and paste the below data into it 

```bash

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://blogger_owner:npg_6VGB0CREmZgl@ep-plain-leaf-a8d0qzyl-pooler.eastus2.azure.neon.tech/blogger?sslmode=require

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_KEY=322395274971586
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_SECRET=2blGibaP9XDXXX3jpOOLXVTh5Xo
```


run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
